THESE ARE EXTRA NOTES AND THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR:

# - FOR PHONES, IT WAS MADE FOR ANDROID BECAUSE IOS IGNORES USER-SCALABILITY RULE FOR BROWSERS, RUINING BROWSER EXPERIENCE FOR USERS. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO WORK AROUND THIS RULE IGNORANCE FOR JAVASCRIPT LANGUAGE

# - IT STILL WORKS ON IOS BUT WILL LOOK VERY BROKEN, RECOMMENDED TO USE ANDROID

# - NOT SURE IF IT WORKS ON TABLETS (NOT TESTED)

# - THE https://Bright-Future-International-School.github.io/greenproject DOMAIN DOES NOT CONTAIN THE INTERVIEW VIDEO. I REPEAT, IT DOESN'T CONTAIN THE INTERVIEW UPDATE. DOUBLE CHECK TO SEE IF ITS A EMBED YOUTUBE VIDEO.
